Having issues with Windows installing updates

If you are having corrution in the software Distrobution folder.  Microsoft recommends you run the following steps.  I have modified that slightly.  They all basically do mostly the same thing.

1. runMeFirst.bat
2. If you issues is resolve move on.  If Else
3. runMeSecond.bat
4. If this process doesn't fix you MS recommands this last step. Else
5. runMeLast.bat

If these don't resolve your issues you will need to take additional steps.
